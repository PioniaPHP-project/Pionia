 * Middleware can run on every request and every response.

 *
 * You can use these to encrypt
 *
 * Remember when the request has not yet fully in the controller, we have no response yet
 *
 * So before that time, only the request is populated.
 *
 * Also, middlewares run before authentication backends therefore on the request part, they have no access to the authenticated
 * user
